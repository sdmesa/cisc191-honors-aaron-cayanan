NOTES FROM THE PROGRAMMER:
Thank you for viewing my honors project for the Intermediate Java class at Mesa College. This project is intended to give
newer programmers an easy to follow guide on how to understand shallow and deep copying in Java. I'd like to also thank my
professor, David Domingo Jr., for the amazing experience I had in his class. Prof. Domingo pushed me to become a better programmer,
answered and clarified any questions I had, as well as acted as a mentor for my Java programming journey.
